			C++ Big Integer Library
	Written and maintained by Mithil Leua<hungrymithil@gmail.com>

You can use this library in a C++ program to do simple arithmetic on integers of size
limited only by your computer's memory.  
The library provides bigint class that represent integers.  

Follows a assembly like arithmetic , rather than normal approach.
	    #include "BigIntegerLibrary.hh"
	    BigInteger a("65536");
	    a.multiply(a);

The code in `test.cc' demonstrates the most important features of the library.
To get started quickly, read the code and explanations in that file and run it.
If you want more detail or a feature not shown in `sample.cc', consult the
consult the actual header and source files.

This library emphasizes ease of use and clarity of implementation over speed.The code is
intended to be reasonably portable across computers and modern C++ compilers; in
particular, it uses whatever word size the computer provides (32-bit, 64-bit, or
otherwise).

Compiling programs that use the library
---------------------------------------
Just include "bigint.cc" to your program, that would be fine.


Bugs and enhancements
---------------------
If you find a bug, please report it, whether it comes in the form of compiling
trouble, a mathematically inaccurate result, or a memory-management blunder.
You are also welcome to request enhancements.Since it is pretty basic library,
other suggestions are welcome as well. 

I would be delighted to hear from you if you like this library or find a good use for it.
